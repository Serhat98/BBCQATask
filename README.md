•             Endpoint: https://testapi.io/api/ottplatform/media
•             Create some BDD scenarios and automate them using Java to test the API


• My framework is Cucumber (BDD).
•	I built my framework using Java Programming Language.
•	I used maven as a build automation tool for my java project.
•	I used cucumber-junit and Cucumber runner to orchestrate tests.
•	Cucumber with Gherkin language for non-technical people to understand testing. 

. I generated POJO classes from the JSON response.
. I created a MediaClient to use in step definitions.
. Inside the Cucumber runner, I used glues in order to connect feature files to step definitions.
•	I have utilities package, which contains utility classes such as ConfigurationReader and APIUtils.
•	In Feature folder I planned to store my feature files separately, it helps in usability of the codes.
•	Step Definitions folder is the place where my actual test scripts are.
. I also use tags for tests that I want to run in bulk.
•	My framework is completely easy to maintain.
